Before using any of the software in this archive, read this carefully.
=======================================================================
None of this was created/compiled by me, I simply put them all into a single archive and uploaded it to GitHub so preserve these for years. The effects are already showing and a lot of things are no-
longer available for download, even with the wayback machine.

Do not use this in 2021. Unless you have a console with an ancient system menu version and a drivechip for some things in the "drivechip-stuff" folder, you're not gonna be able to use it and in worse cases,
might even brick your console permanently. Before you mess with this kind of stuff, install BootMii as boot2 and a modern version of Priiloader. If you cannot install BootMii as boot2 then you should avoid
everything this archive has to offer. I will not nor will the developers of this stuff help you use ancient software that has been deprecated for over 10 years.

This is simply an archive to preserve history. Use this at your own risk.
