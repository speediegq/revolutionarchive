# revolutionarchive

### The ultimate archive of Wii exploits, homebrew, firmwares, mods, emulators and much much more.
### Most of this was not in any way created by me. I simply put all of these into one package for your enjoyment
## Nothing here should contain pirated media, for such content check out the NUS Downloader or use the good ol' Google

### Depending on where you live though, homebrew might be illegal. If you are concerned about this fact, leave!

# WARNING!
##### What I'm hosting here is 100% deprecated, unofficial and potentially dangerous software which should NOT be used on a modern console.
##### The only way to safely use what I have available here is to install the LATEST version of Priiloader (not preloader) and bootmii as boot2.
##### If you cannot accept this fact then you shouldn't use this. The original developers nor myself will provide any support or provide ANY kind of "warranty".
##### Also, Priiloader is in many cases not enough. It's better but for the best protection, you'll need bootmii as boot2.

# Note about system menu versions and IOS
##### Since this is old software/homebrew, I cannot guarrantee that these will work on the latest version nor at all.
##### There's a huge chance that a lot if not all of this won't work on newer versions than 3.2 due to the trucha bug (Signing bug) getting patched in later versions.
##### If you need features from a newer system version, update your IOS(s) and cIOS and block updates through Priiloader.

## Thank you!
