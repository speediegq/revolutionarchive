# revolutionarchive

### My archiving project where I attempt to archive (haha) Wii homebrew/exploits from history.
### Currently contains a lot of exploits, modchip stuff, old hackmii installers, etc.
### Use everything here on your own risk. This is all ancient software over 10 years old at least.
### Not anywhere near complete, however if you'd like to contribute, dm me on Discord (speedie#8260)

NOTE: USED TO CONTAIN NINTENDO WADS, IOS, ETC. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED. IF YOU WANT THOSE, USE NUS DOWNLOADER
